They are named.\n\n```javacript\nsch.addHandler('something', function(item) {\n  // do something\n});\n```\n\n\n## .addPicker(iter: function, time: int, limit: int)\n\nPickers filter the queue. They are run every `time` milliseconds, and can\nbe limited to `limit` items per run (`limit` is optional); the default is to go\nthrough everything. They are passed the item and nothing else, and have access\nto two methods on the `this` object:\n\n- `this.stop()` stops the current picker run after the present iteration.\n\n- `this.handle(name: string)` schedules the handler `name` to be\n  executed with the item as parameter. As soon as `this.handle()`\n  is called, the item is removed from the queue. Subsequent calls\n  to `this.handle()` *within the same function* will schedule\n  additional handlers for the same item.\n\n```javascript\nvar pickerId = sch.addPicker(function(item) {\n  if (item % 2 === 0) {\n    this.handle('something');\n  }\n  \n  if (item === 42) {\n    this.stop();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIt returns the `pickerId`, which can be used to modify the picker at runtime.\nThis is mostly useful to adjust the `interval` or `limit`. A limit of 0 will\ndisable the picker.\n\n\n## .start()\n\nStart processing the queue. Useful if you need to do some preparation before\nfiring things off but still want to be able to push things onto the queue.\n\n\n## .pickers\n\nAccess the array of pickers. This is useful to modify a picker, see above.\n\n\n## .started\n\nYou may want to know whether you've called start() yet. Or not.\n\n## Debug mode\n\nUsing `debug: true` in the instantiation config exposes both internal queues\n(`todo` and `doing`) and the `handlers` object. These are not useful for most\ncases, but if you need them they're just a flag away, no need to tweak shit.\n\n\nCommunity\n=========\n\n- All authors and contributors are listed in the `package.json`.\n- Pull requests need to adhere to the [style guide].\n- API is tested.
